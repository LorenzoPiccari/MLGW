\begin{abstract}
We apply Machine Learning methods to build a model designed to generate a gravitational waveform in the time domain as produced by a binary black hole coalescence. 
Our model matches in accuracy the performance of the state-of-the-art direct computations while, at the same time, it provides a speed up of a a factor of $\sim 30$ in the generation of the waveform. 
Furthermore, it provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters. This open the possibility to further improve the sampling algorithms used for the parameter estimation.
\par
We train our model on a number of waveforms computed by \texttt{TEOBResumS} and we infer a relation between the waveform and the masses $m_1$,$m_2$ and (aligned) spins $s_1$, $s_2$ of the two BHs. 
%We reduce the dimensionality of our problem by decomposing each waveform in amplitude and phase and it is further represented in a lower dimensional space using a Principal Component Analysis. The regression from orbital parameters to principal components is performed using a Mixture of Expert model.
Our implementation is publicly available as a \texttt{Python} package \texttt{mlgw} as \url{https://pypi.org/project/mlgw/}.
\texttt{mlgw} has all the features required for performing a full parameter estimation (including the waveform dependence on geometrical parameters). 
We demonstrate the faithfulness of \texttt{mlgw} by successfully reproducing the inference on GW150914 made by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration.
