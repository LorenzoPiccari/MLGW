%We apply Machine Learning methods to build a model designed to generate a gravitational waveform in the time domain as produced by a binary black hole coalescence. 
%Our model matches the accuracy of the state-of-the-art EOB models and has a tiny generation cost, equivalent to those of a fast Reduced Order Model.
%As the generation time does not depend on the lenght of the signal, the model is particularly suitable for long observation surveys, such as ET.
%Furthermore, it provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters. This could lead to a further improvement of the sampling algorithms employed for the parameter estimation.
%We train our model on a number of waveforms computed by \texttt{TEOBResumS} and we infer a relation between the waveform and the masses $m_1$, $m_2$ and (aligned) spins $s_1$, $s_2$ of the two BHs. 
%Our implementation is publicly available as a Python package \texttt{mlgw} as \url{https://pypi.org/project/mlgw/}.
%\texttt{mlgw} has all the features required for performing a full parameter estimation (including the waveform dependence on geometrical parameters). 
%We employ \texttt{mlgw} to analyse the public data from GWTC-1, the first GW transient catalog. Our results are largely compatible with those published by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration.

We apply machine learning methods to build a time-domain model for
gravitational waveforms from binary black hole mergers called \texttt{mlgw}.
The dimensionality of the problem is handled by representing the 
waveform's amplitude and phase using a principal component analysis.
We train \texttt{mlgw} on about $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ \texttt{TEOBResumS} effective-one-body
waveforms with mass ratios $q\in[1,20]$ and aligned dimensionless
spins $\chi\in[-0.80,0.95]$. The resulting model is faithful to the
training set at the ${\sim}10^{-3}$ level (averaged on the parameter space), while speeding up the single waveform generation of a factor 10-50 (depending on the
binary mass and initial frequency.)
Furthermore, \texttt{mlgw} provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an information might be for future improvements in GW data analysis.
As demonstration of the capabilities of \texttt{mlgw} to perform a
full parameter estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first
GW transient catalog (GWTC-1). We find broadly consistent results with previous analyses at a fraction of the cost, although the analysis with spin aligned waveforms gives systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to analysis with precessing waveforms.
Since the generation time does not depend on the length of the signal,
our model is particularly suitable for the analysis of long signals
and/or and in view of third-generation detectors.
Future applications include the analysis of waveform systematics and
model selection in parameter estimation.
