Dear Bharathi Sundararajan,

Thank you very much for your kind email and sorry for the late reply.

I respond below to the questions raised in the notice to the authors:

1.NR stands for Numerical Relativity (not for non relativistic)
2.Correct: BBH stands for Binary Black Hole
3.LISA stands for "Laser Interferometer Space Antenna"
4.BNS stands for Binary Neutron Star
5.Ok
6.We confirm that the funding agencies were properly identified
7.We confirm that the repetition of the grant number '406116891' is correct
8.Every link seems to work fine
9.Ok
10.Location: Rome, Italy
11.Location: Deep Learning for Physical Sciences workshop at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Long Beach, CA, US
12.Publisher: Neural Information Processing Systems
13.The correction in page number you propose is correct: indeed, the right page number is “135628”
14.Unfortunately, no further publication information is available yet

Besides the comments above, I do not see any correction that needs to be made.

I remain available for any further clarification you may need.

Best regards,

Stefano Schmidt
