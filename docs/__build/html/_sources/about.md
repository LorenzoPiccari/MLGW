Hi!

The project started as my master thesis in the University of Pisa under the supervision of Prof. Dal Pozzo: we made a ML model to generate the 22 dominant mode.
Now I work as [PhD](https://www.uu.nl/staff/sschmidt) at Utrecht University and the project is growing: together with Tim, as part of his bachelor thesis at Utrecht, we added the Higher Order Modes to the waveform and we improved the regression accuracy.

If you want to reach me out, you ca find me at: [s.schmidt@uu.nl](mailto:s.schmidt@uu.nl) or [stefanoschmidt1995@gmail.com](mailto:stefanoschmidt1995@gmail.com).
I will be happy to hear your comments/suggestion or just to have a chat.
